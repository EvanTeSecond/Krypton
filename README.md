Krypton has a powerful collection of utilities that can help bypass school restrictions. Krypton provides features such as an about:blank opener, a data:text URL opener and generator (thx to Blobby Boi for some of the code), and tools to disable browser extensions. Krypton also offers multiple games.

# Usage
1. Open https://kryptontools.pages.dev/ or https://kryptontools.glitch.me/.
2. There are 3 options to open Krypton with.
   about:blank cloaks with an about:blank URL
   blob:https cloaks with a blob:https followed by a temporary URL
   data:text works by copying to clipboard a data:text URL of Krypton which is openable (html wont allow opening data:text URLs automatically)
3. clicking any of them will lead to a 404 page.
4. type anywhere on the screen "404pnf" and click right shift. If it doesn't work, you typoed or started typing too early.
