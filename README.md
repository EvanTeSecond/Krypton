# Krypton
Krypton has a powerful collection of utilities that can help bypass school restrictions. Krypton provides features such as an about:blank opener, a data:url generator (thx to Blobby Boi for some of the code), and tools to disable browser extensions.

# Usage
1. Open https://kryptontools.pages.dev/.
2. Choose which method you want to use.
   #### For about:blank
1. Click the about:blank button, then allow popups at the right side of the search bar and reload (If you haven't already.)
2. Once it opens http://classroom.google.com/u/0/h, it should load a 404 page not found error in a couple of seconds.
3. To get around this, type "404pnf" and press right shift (It is just an invisible input box that auto selects itself)
4. If nothing happens you typoed something so redo steps 3-6 or simply press Ctrl + A and re-enter "404pnf" then press right shift.
5. Once you press right shift, it should load the main site.
   #### For data:text URL
1. Click the data:text URL button (which copies to clipboard the URL, HTML is unable to open data:text URLS automatically), then paste it in the search bar.
2. Now it should load a 404 page not found error.
3. To get around this, type "404pnf" and press right shift (It is just an invisible input box that auto selects itself)
4. If nothing happens you typoed something so redo steps 1-3 or simply press Ctrl + A and re-enter "404pnf" then press right shift.
