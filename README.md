# Krypton
Krypton has a powerful collection of utilities that can help bypass school restrictions. Krypton provides features such as an about:blank opener, a data:url generator (thx to Blobby Boi for some of the code), and tools to disable browser extensions.

# Usage
1. Open https://kryptontools.pages.dev/.
2. Allow popups at the right side of the search bar and reload (If you haven't already.)
4. Once it opens http://classroom.google.com/u/0/h, it should load a 404 page not found error in a couple of seconds.
5. To get around this, type "404pnf" and press right shift.
6. If nothing happens you typoed something so, redo steps 1-5.
7. Once you press right shift, it should load the main site.

# Features
1. about:blank opener: Cloak any page with about:blank.
2. data:url Generator: Generate data URLs, a tool for opening files directly in the browser (code contributed by @Blobby Boi).
3. Extension Disabler: Disable unwanted browser extensions to create a clean browsing environment.
4. Bypass Restrictions: A set of tools that helps bypass school or browsing restrictions.
